Remote tracking branches
If you run git branch --all in your repository, you will notice a long list of branches. The branches that (by default) appear in red are the remote tracking branches. These branches are read only copies of the branches on the remote. These update every time you run git fetch or git pull.

These don't take up much room, so it's okay that Git does this by default. But, these will stack up over time - they are not deleted automatically.

To delete the remote tracking branches that are deleted on the remote, run git fetch --prune. This is safe to do if you are using GitHub, because branches merged via pull requests can be restored.
